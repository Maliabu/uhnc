                        <p>
                            These are essential food nutrients that our bodies turn into glucose to provide energy for the proper functioning of the body. There are basically three forms to foods that form total carbohydrates and these include starches, sugars and fibers. Before
                            we go into details, these carbohydrates are divided into digestible and indigestible Among the digestible we have the sugars and the starches.

                        <h4 class="font-weight-lighter py-3">Sugars</h4>
                        <p>Sugars are either chemically in one (monosaccharides ie, fructose, glucose and galactose) or two molecules( disaccharides ie sucrose and lactose). These are easily digestible and can occur naturally in foods such as fruits. Other
                            sugars are artificially added in foods such as sodas, cookies, sweets These simple carbohydrates (sucrose) are easily absorbed thus causing a rapid increase of glucose in blood and this physiologically causes an insulin response
                            to act on the glucose. </p>
                        <p>There fore, with this, increased intake of added sugars such as the beverages and snacks increases ones risk of getting cardiometabolic diseases and inparticular type 2 diabetes. WHO recommends not more than 10% daily energy from
                            sugars and actually reduced this to not more than 5%. This includes added sugars in honey, syrups and fruit juices.</p>

                        <p>
                            These are present in most of the staple foods that we eat such as rice, potatoes, cassava, pasta wheat and many more. Put a picture of examples of such food stuffs. These consist of multiple sugar units (polysaccharides) or complex sugars, These take
                            more time to digest than the simple sugars and so they increase blood sugars.

                        </p>
                        <p>Various researchers and proved that replacement of simple sugars with complex sugars have shown a great benefit on reduction of LDL cholesterol but not on blood pressure and hyperstension. This means that increased consumption
                            of these foods have a direct effect on the risk of getting cardiometabolic diseases.</p>

                            These are also known as dietary fibre and are usually present inplant foods. Examples of such foods include whole grains, bread, creals, legumes, nuts and vegetables. Fibres are not digested by enzymes within the digestive and with this, no elevation
                            in blood glucose is caused by their consumption. Instead they decrease gastric emptying and have a bulk effect in the gut. Because of these, they give a feeling of satiety.

                            of minerals such magnesium, potassium and vitamin C which play a significant role in reducing the risk for cardiometabolic disease.

                                <p>In wine, there is wisdom, in beer there is freedom and yes these can also cheer you up. But remember, too much of everything is always bad. For we all know, alcohol leads to liver damage, physical and physiological dependence.
                                    But in recent studies, although notably no official recommendations, drinking wine in moderate amounts has got some benefits especially with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes and other metabolic
                                    syndromes.

                                        Wine contains antioxidants, anti-inflammatory and lipid regulating effects. Following the CDC guidelines,

                                        1 glass of wine per day for females and 2 glasses of wine for males Anything more than this can be hazardous to your health.

                            <p>Sugary beverages, such as soda and packed juices These are termed as SSB (sugar shortened beverages). They are very easy to grab and most available on every ones turn. They rapidly increase the glucose levels in the body, increasing
                                the risks of type two diabetes and hypertension.
                            </p>
                            <p>For juices, its always better to make and take fresh juice and since they contain natural sugars, I would rather, you add little or no sugar at all. Best option is eating the whole fruit, for blending also concentratess the
                                sugars in the fruits. Not forgetting the roughages found on the peeling s that is usually cut out.</p>

                    <h2 class="font-weight-lighter">Salt</h2>
                    <p>Did you know that most of the salt in our diets is added during food processing and a small amount in available naturally in foods. Salt contains 40% sodium and 60% chloride. Yes, salt is important in the body as its used for muscle
                        and nerve functioning, fluid balance and blood pressure regulation. 90% of the salt consumed is excreted in feaces, urine and salt. That’s why some of you enjoy the taste of the sweat. That means, just a small amount of salt is
                        required in the body for the physiological functions. This can be got through the foods we eat.
                    </p>
                    <p>WHO recommends maximum of 2gms of sodium per day One may wonder why we regulate the amount of salt consumption, well eating too much salt leads to water retention in the body, as a result, in the long run, the kidneys may get damaged
                        and the blood pressure goes up. Controversially, potassium is a good mineral which eliminate the excess sodium in the body thus promoting electrolyte balance, regulating blood pressure thus decreasing the risk of cardiovascular
                        disease and kidney disease. Therefore, for cardiovascular disease prevention, avoid processed foods that contain lots of added salt and choose healthy foods such as fruits, vegetables, fish, dairy products and other plant foods
                        that are rich in sodium.
