                            habits are more likely to stay with you when you learn them as a child. <br> <br> Amidst the daily busy schedules, we can still ensure our kids are not just having enough to eat but health food. This will reduce the chances
                            of developing malnutrition (over nutrition) and it's related side effects such as chronic diseases ( diabetes type 2 and hypertension).

                    <p>
                        These are essential food nutrients that our bodies turn into glucose to provide energy for the proper functioning of the body. There are basically three forms to foods that form total carbohydrates and these include starches, sugars and fibers. Before
                        we go into details, these carbohydrates are divided into digestible and indigestible Among the digestible we have the sugars and the starches.

                        <p>Sugars are either chemically in one (monosaccharides ie, fructose, glucose and galactose) or two molecules( disaccharides ie sucrose and lactose). These are easily digestible and can occur naturally in foods such as fruits. Other
                            sugars are artificially added in foods such as sodas, cookies, sweets These simple carbohydrates (sucrose) are easily absorbed thus causing a rapid increase of glucose in blood and this physiologically causes an insulin response
                            to act on the glucose. There fore, with this, increased intake of added sugars such as the beverages and snacks increases ones risk of getting cardiometabolic diseases and inparticular type 2 diabetes. WHO recommends not more
                            than 10% daily energy from sugars and actually reduced this to not more than 5%. This includes added sugars in honey, syrups and fruit juices.

                            These are present in most of the staple foods that we eat such as rice, potatoes, cassava, pasta wheat and many more. Put a picture of examples of such food stuffs. These consist of multiple sugar units (polysaccharides) or complex sugars, These take
                            more time to digest than the simple sugars and so they increase blood sugars. Various researchers and proved that replacement of simple sugars with complex sugars have shown a great benefit on reduction of LDL cholesterol but
                            not on blood pressure and hyperstension. This means that increased consumption of these foods have a direct effect on the risk of getting cardiometabolic diseases.

                            These are also known as dietary fibre and are usually present inplant foods. Examples of such foods include whole grains, bread, creals, legumes, nuts and vegetables. Fibres are not digested by enzymes within the digestive and with this, no elevation
                            in blood glucose is caused by their consumption. Instead they decrease gastric emptying and have a bulk effect in the gut. Because of these, they give a feeling of satiety. Due to the above feeling it gives, there will be a
                            reduced rate of hunger, that usually make you and me grab sugary snack. So do we agree these are the best form of carbohydrates for our health?. On addition, they are a source of minerals such magnesium, potassium and vitamin
                            C which play a significant role in reducing the risk for cardiometabolic disease.

                    the world and it comes with a bucket of benefits such as refreshing and hydrating the body which facilitates body function.

                    <li>
                        Water is the best beverage for quenching ones thirst and rehydrating the body. Wonder why after a tiresome journey or jog or exercise, feel like a bottle or glass of water, yes it’s the only one to satisfy that feeling and feel a live again.

                <p>One may ask, how much water do I need to take a day? Well, this cant have a direct answer, the needs for water vary with ones level of activity, the weather condition, physiological condition (disease such as diabetes) , how much you eat,
                    what you eat. Therefore, with this, it can be hard to estimate the standard amount of water one should take. But from research the 8 glasses a day can do for you. I mean this should be the minimum Remember Water is life!!

                <p>The next beverage we shall talk about is coffee and tea These are the second commonest beverages consumed worldwide. And both contain caffeine although tea has reduced concentration of caffeine compared to coffee Coffee has got what we
                    call polyphenols and one of then is diterpenes. Diterpenes is mainly got in unfiltered coffee. Being an oily substance, it increases the level of low densisity(LDL) which increases the risks of cardiometabolic diseases such as heart
                    attack. With this, its better off to take filtered coffee to remove these impurities.\ Tea contains reduced concentration of caffeine but has flavanols which are characterized to reducing blood pressure thus reduced risk for stroke
                    Nevertheless, the addition of cream, sugar, whipped cream and other flavorings turn coffee and tea from a healthy beverage to unhealthy ones

                        <p>Sugary beverages, such as soda and packed juices These are termed as SSB (sugar shortened beverages). They are very easy to grab and most available on every ones turn. They rapidly increase the glucose levels in the body, increasing
                            the risks of type two diabetes and hypertension. For juices, its always better to make and take fresh juice and since they contain natural sugars, I would rather, you add little or no sugar at all. Best option is eating the
                            whole fruit, for blending also concentratess the sugars in the fruits. Not forgetting the roughages found on the peeling s that is usually cut out.

                <p>Did you know that most of the salt in our diets is added during food processing and a small amount in available naturally in foods. Salt contains 40% sodium and 60% chloride. Yes, salt is important in the body as its used for muscle and
                    nerve functioning, fluid balance and blood pressure regulation. 90% of the salt consumed is excreted in feaces, urine and salt. That’s why some of you enjoy the taste of the sweat. That means, just a small amount of salt is required
                    in the body for the physiological functions. This can be got through the foods we eat.
                </p>
                <p>WHO recommends maximum of 2gms of sodium per day One may wonder why we regulate the amount of salt consumption, well eating too much salt leads to water retention in the body, as a result, in the long run, the kidneys may get damaged and
                    the blood pressure goes up. Controversially, potassium is a good mineral which eliminate the excess sodium in the body thus promoting electrolyte balance, regulating blood pressure thus decreasing the risk of cardiovascular disease
                    and kidney disease. Therefore, for cardiovascular disease prevention, avoid processed foods that contain lots of added salt and choose healthy foods such as fruits, vegetables, fish, dairy products and other plant foods that are rich
                    in sodium.
