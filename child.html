                        One of the best things we can do for our children besides investing in their future, through education and savings, adopting good healthy eating habits could be gold. <br><br> These will continue till adult hood since health habits
                        are more likely to stay with you when you learn them as a child. <br> <br> Amidst the daily busy schedules, we can still ensure our kids are not just having enough to eat but health food. This will reduce the chances of developing
                        malnutrition (over nutrition) and it's related side effects such as chronic diseases ( diabetes type 2 and hypertension).

                        This is the first meal of the day, and we should ensure it containing all nutrients that's is proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins and some fats. Forexample millet porridge with milk, egg sandwich ( whole or wheat bread), plus fruits. These will also keep
                        the child full for some time and eliminate the urge to look for snacks. But ensure to give them a fruit salad or other health snacks before lunch

                    <p class="small">This can be facilitated by making deserts centered around fruits and make them more appealing. Keep the fresh fruits on hand ie, place baskets filled with different fruits and place them in a place they can easily see and get them.
                        Besides, it will act as a reminder, as they see them. Hide the vegetables in other foods especially in their favourite foods. You can grate the vegetables and place them sauces, breads and other pastry. Design the plate( be creative)
